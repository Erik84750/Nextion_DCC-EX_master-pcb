# Nextion_DCC-EX_master-pcb
PCB for Nextion-DCC-EX_enclosures

1. INTRODUCTION


  a. this is a custom made pcb for the Nextion_DCC-EX enclosure series

  b. provided are the Gerber files and the schematic (pdf)

2. GERBER

The gerber files are produced with Elecrow Design Rules constraints. These DRC's require a manufacturer capable of producing high quality prints.

3. Recommended is the PCB fab Elecrow: https://www.elecrow.com/

  This fab uses very low rates (1 USD for 10x 100x100mm boards). The Nextion_DCC-EX_master pcb is designed to fit 2 of these pcb's on, one 100x100mm board.
  If ou desire this output you need to specify your request to the manufacturer: aks for panelization of this pcb (2x 49x99mm pcb on one 100x100mm board).

4. DESCRIPTION:

  a. board version 5a: valid for Pro Mini (and HC-12), ESP8266-12 on basic module, ESP32 dev-kit (38pin, 1" pin row width), and ESP32 basic module

  b. board version 5b: valid for Pro Mini (and HC-12), ESP8266-12 on basic module, ESP32 dev-kit (38pin, 1" pin row width, and 23.5mm pin row width)

  c. board version 5c: valid for Pro Mini (and HC-12), ESP8266-12 NodeMCU and ESP32 basic module
